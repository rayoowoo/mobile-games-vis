# Mobile Games Visualization

This is a data visualization project for a [dataset on iOS mobile games](https://www.kaggle.com/tristan581/17k-apple-app-store-strategy-games), taken from Kaggle. It is meant to be a first foray into Pandas and Flask. The dataset is minimally processed (largely just deduped and then binned), queried using Flask, and served as an API to a React front end. The data is visualized via d3.js.
